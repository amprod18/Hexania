# Hexania
Geometric calculator in development

(Run main_front script to use the calculator)

This calculator is still in development so it will have bugs, mistakes and missing features that will be implemented in the future.

As a guide, I'm usign the background color to indicate if a polygon is properly tested and working (which is None as of right now). However the program calculates everything and shows it, just is not tested to see if the results are properly calculated.
Feel free to check the help menu for more understanding of the basic management of the script.

In the future hexania will become a desktop application and other versions working (doing calculations) in other ways will be tested for 
speed and precision purposes.
These other working ways are eqsolving with 'sympy', api implementation with 'ChatGPT' and polygon generalization through triangularization.
