# Hexania
geometric calculator in development

--main_front is the script to run to use the calculator--

This calculator is still in development so i will have bugs, mistakes and missing features that will be implemented in the future.

As a guide, I'm usign the a background color to indicate if a polygon is properly tested and working (which is None as of right now).
Feel free to check the help menu for more understanding of the basic management of the script.

In the future hexania will become a desktop application and other versions working (doing calculations) in other ways will be tested for 
speed and precision purposes
