# Hexania

## Overview

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Hexania is a Python program that allows users to perform calculations on various 2D geometric figures. By providing the necessary parameters, the calculator automatically calculates additional properties of the figure and displays the formulas used for the calculations. In future updates, the program will also include a feature to display the figure at scale.

## Features

- Interactive menu system for selecting different geometric figures.
- Submenu for entering figure parameters.
- Automatic calculation of additional properties based on provided parameters.
- Display of the formulas used for calculations.
- Future plan to implement advanced techniques such as sympy equation solving, triangulation and neural networks.
**Note:** The color of the polygon shows if it has been properly tested (none at the moment).

## Disclaimer

**Note:** This program is currently under active development and may contain bugs or incomplete features. It is not recommended for use in production or critical environments.

We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to report any issues or suggestions through the project's issue tracker. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we work towards improving and stabilizing the program.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/amprod18/Hexania.git
 ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd Hexania
  ```

3. No need for installing dependencies!! The program check by itself if something is missing and installs it automatically.
 
## Usage

To run the calculator, execute the following command:
 ```bash
 python main_front.py
 ```

Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate the menu and enter the desired parameters for each figure. The calculator will then perform the necessary calculations and display the results, along with the corresponding formulas used.

## Future Enhancements

We have plans to further enhance the Geometric 2D Calculator with the following features:

- GUI rebuild in custom tkinter
- Integration of the sympy library to solve equations and simplify calculations.
- Implementation of triangulation techniques to enable the drawing of any shape.
- Exploration of neural networks to automate complex calculations.

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to help us achieve these goals.
